# Blackbaud Myschoolapp Client
Code to interface with myschoolapp.com's API.  Used in unified-assignment-center.appsot.com.  
This code merely exposes the API calls again over a server on localhost to get around cross origin header problems.  

# Warning!:
Much of this code is 4+ years old.  It also does not support Python 3.  I should probably clean it up some.
